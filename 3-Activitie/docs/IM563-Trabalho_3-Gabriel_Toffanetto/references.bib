abstract = {Modern applications of industrial automation and robotics are increasingly relying on image processing techniques. This paper shows ways in which image processing can be applied to solve actual problems in robotics and instrumentation. The paper starts by presenting the fundamentals of camera models, digital acquisition of images and selected processing techniques, followed by examples of applications of such knowledge. Four examples of image processing applications are shown: rim detection in automotive wheel images, dimensional verification of crankshafts, measurement of wheel alignment angles of a car and a stereo visual odometry algorithm for mobile robotics. The examples not only illustrate the uses of different image processing techniques, but may also inspire the development of new robotic and industrial automation products.}
